### Cluster 7: **"Long Intergenic Non-Coding and Antisense RNA Regulatory Gene Network Cluster"**

---

### **Overview**
The name **"Long Intergenic Non-Coding and Antisense RNA Regulatory Gene Network Cluster"** reflects the defining characteristics of this gene group: its composition of non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that either originate from intergenic regions or are antisense to protein-coding sequences. These RNAs are pivotal in regulating gene expression, chromatin architecture, and cellular signaling, often acting at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. This cluster highlights the crucial roles of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) and antisense RNAs in orchestrating genomic and cellular functions.

- **"Long Intergenic Non-Coding"** emphasizes lincRNAs, which act as molecular scaffolds, epigenetic regulators, and transcription modulators.
- **"Antisense RNA"** captures transcripts that influence gene expression by interacting with complementary RNA sequences or chromatin.
- **"Regulatory Gene Network"** underscores the broader functional system where these RNAs interact to maintain genomic stability and cellular processes.

Together, these RNAs form a regulatory framework essential for cellular homeostasis, adaptation, and stress response.
